# YonixAlpha

Private, automated trading intelligence and execution platform. See
`ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md` and `REUSE_MATRIX.md` for the Phase 0 audit of the
reference repositories this platform draws patterns from.

## Status

**Phase 1 — Foundation.** What exists today: project structure, config,
structured logging, PostgreSQL + Redis, Alembic migrations, Docker Compose
(dev/prod), health checks, JWT authentication with a single admin account,
and a minimal dashboard shell. No trading engine exists yet — `TRADING_ENABLED`
and `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED` are hardcoded false-by-default and nothing in this
codebase can place an order. See the phase list in the original spec for what
comes next (data infrastructure, the three Solana engines, the Binance
Futures engine, the shared risk/decision system, ML, paper trading, the full
dashboard, deployment, hardening).

## Repository layout

```
apps/
  api/     FastAPI backend (Python 3.12, SQLAlchemy async, Alembic, Redis)
  web/     Next.js dashboard (TypeScript, App Router)
infra/
  docker/  docker-compose.yml + dev/prod overrides
  nginx/   reverse proxy config (HTTP only until TLS is provisioned)
```

`services/`, `packages/`, and the rest of `docs/` from the proposed structure
in `ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md` are introduced starting Phase 2, when there's an
actual second consumer to share code with — no empty scaffolding for
not-yet-existing engines.

## Local development

Requires Docker + Docker Compose. Postgres and Redis run in containers; the
API and web app hot-reload from your working tree.

1. `cp .env.example .env`
2. Fill in `JWT_SECRET` (`openssl rand -hex 32`), `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and
   `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` (see below). Leave the Solana/Binance/Telegram vars
   blank — nothing in Phase 1 reads them.
3. From the repo root:
   ```
   docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml -f infra/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
   ```
4. API: http://localhost:8000/api/health · Web: http://localhost:3000

### Generating an admin password hash

```
cd apps/api && python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "from app.core.security import hash_password; print(hash_password('your-password'))"
```

Paste the output into `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` in `.env`. The plaintext password
is never stored anywhere. Changing the hash and restarting the API rotates
the admin password (see `app/main.py::_seed_admin_user`).

### Running the backend without Docker

```
cd apps/api
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
alembic upgrade head          # requires a running Postgres; see DATABASE_URL
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Running the backend test suite

Tests run against a real Postgres and Redis (not sqlite/fakeredis, so the
schema's JSONB/UUID/INET types are exercised as written):

```
cd apps/api && . .venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/ -v
```

`tests/conftest.py` expects `postgresql+asyncpg://yonixalpha:yonixalpha_test_pw@localhost:5432/yonixalpha_test`
and `redis://localhost:6379/15` by default — override via `DATABASE_URL` /
`REDIS_URL` env vars, or create that role/database locally.

### Running the frontend without Docker

```
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production deployment

Not yet documented — this lands with Phase 9 (`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`), once
there's an engine worth deploying. The `docker-compose.prod.yml` override and
`infra/nginx/nginx.conf` are a starting skeleton (no TLS cert provisioning
wired up yet — that requires the live `yonixalpha.com` DNS pointed at the
droplet first).

## Security notes

- `.env` is never committed (see `.gitignore`); only `.env.example` is.
- Login is rate-limited: 5 failed attempts locks the account out for 15
  minutes (`apps/api/app/api/routes/auth.py`).
- Refresh tokens rotate on every use and are individually revocable
  (`sessions` table) — a leaked refresh token is usable exactly once.
- Passwords are hashed with argon2 (`passlib`), never stored or logged in
  plaintext.
- See `ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md` §3 for what was verified clean (and what
  wasn't) in the five reference repositories this codebase draws patterns
  from.
